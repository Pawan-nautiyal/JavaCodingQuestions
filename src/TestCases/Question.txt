String Manipulation:
1️⃣ String Reverse: Use a loop to traverse the characters in reverse order and construct the reversed string.
2️⃣ Reverse Words: Split the string into words, reverse the order of the words, and then join them back into a string.
3️⃣ String Palindrome: Compare characters from the start and end, moving towards each other. If all characters match, it's a palindrome.
4️⃣ Two-String Anagram: Count occurrences of each character in both strings using a map or an array. If the counts match for all characters, the strings are anagrams.
5️⃣ Remove Duplicates from a String: Use a data structure (e.g., set) to keep track of characters seen so far and construct the resulting string.

Array Manipulation:
6️⃣ Array Reverse: Use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end, and swap elements while moving towards each other.
7️⃣ Max/Min Number from Array: Initialize two variables to track the maximum and minimum values. Traverse the array, updating these variables accordingly.
8️⃣ Second Min/Max Number from Array: Sort the array and access the second element for the second smallest/largest number.
9️⃣ Find Common Elements: Implement a method to find common elements between two arrays.
1️⃣0️⃣ Find Duplicate in Array: Given an array where each value appears twice except for one value, find that single non-duplicate value.
1️⃣1️⃣ Sort Array without Built-In Sort Methods: Implement selection sort and bubble sort algorithms to sort an array.

Number Manipulation:
1️⃣2️⃣ Number Palindrome: Find if a given number is a palindrome without converting it to a string.
1️⃣3️⃣ Even or Odd: Implement a method that determines if an integer is even or odd.
1️⃣4️⃣ Factorial Calculation: Write a method to calculate the factorial of a given integer using both iterative and recursive approaches.
1️⃣5️⃣ Binary Search: Implement a binary search algorithm to find the index of a target element in a sorted array.
1️⃣6️⃣ Check Power of Two: Write a method to determine if a given integer is a power of two.
1️⃣7️⃣ Calculate GCD and LCM: Write methods to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
1️⃣8️⃣ Find Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Data Structures and Algorithms:
1️⃣9️⃣ Count Letters (Map): Create a method that counts the occurrences of each character in a string and returns a map.
2️⃣0️⃣ Check Balanced Parentheses: Create a method to check if a given string containing parentheses is balanced (each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis).
